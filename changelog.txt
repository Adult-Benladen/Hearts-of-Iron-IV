# AI
##################################

- fixed a case where Japan would ASK to join germanys wars despite doing badly with china 
- nations with restrictive modifiers for joining factions (japan) now super careful about accepting calls to arms to majors (soviet) when still at war with major neighbors (china)
- ai should now no longer get stuck on super large trades and better fulfill its needs (basically skipped the full-trade logic) 
- AI now looks for trades in priority order of biggest lack 
- AI now prefers trade with closer nations if naval transport required 
- AI now likes trading with nations with neutral foreign policy more as they are stable 
- lend lease now automatically cancels when war ends for the receiver 
- AI is now MUCH better at looking at the equipment cost for switching more templates than just one at a time 
- AI cares about infrastructure way more when placing consctruction
- AI should no longer go as happy on naval construction over military (was counting ratio also using civilian so got disproportional large naval part)
- AI us now allowed to trade using more civilian factories 
- Ai should now be much better at going for medium tank divisions. Fixed issues with width being off as well as wrong template being used when evaluatign fitness for changing out lines
- rebalanced ai priorities for medium vs light armor so that ai doesnt get stuck thinking its making light when it isnt
- fixed a case where AI was looking at the wrong type when deciding about template upgrades and could get stuck on motorized
- AI should now show greater interest in researching excavation tech.
- Tweaked templates a bit for majors to avoid getting trapped in subpar targets

- Reduced AI research randomness and improved info in AI research log message
- Made sure AI considers convoy count and possible delivery route before sending lend lease
- AI will now leave potentially hostile nations alone for guarantees until they have generated some actual threat giving you 1-2 smaller wars before you are sucked into the ww2 vortex (makes some minors a lot more playable)
- rebalanced ai priorities for medium vs light armor so that ai doesnt get stuck thinking its making light when it isnt
- fixed a case where AI was looking at the wrong type when deciding about template upgrades and could get stuck on motorized
- Improved AI trade law logic selection
